# edge-login-ui

This repository contains the source code for edge-login-ui-web and edge-login-ui-rn. These two packages provide login interfaces for the Web and for React Native.

To get started developing, just run `yarn`. This will install all the dependencies for both packages. Then just switch into whichever package directory you want to work with and begin developing.

You should run the following scripts from this top-level directory:

* yarn flow
* yarn format
* yarn lint
* yarn lint --fix

This project uses a git pre-commit hook to automatically run flow & lint before every commit.
